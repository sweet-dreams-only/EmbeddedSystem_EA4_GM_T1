Nxtr Manufacturing Component Development Guide
========================================================================================================================
The following guidelines apply to both common and program specific components.  There are some notable changes since
EA3 in the context of CMS.  First and foremost, Nxtr services no longer share an ID with customer services by
default.  As such, all Nxtr CMS services are defined within a pair of ODX files (one each for the common services
and the program specific services).  These ODX files become the starting point when creating or editing CMS services.
From there, various scripts assist in code generation, ARXML generation, merging, and documentation generation.

Another noteworthy change is to the program specific services.  The intent on EA4 is to share the program specific
services between all programs from the same customer.  This will allow the programs to share a set of common customer
specific manufacturing requirements.


Component Modification Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Update ODX file in doc folder (See OdxGuide.txt for more information).
2. Run OdxGen.bat in tools folder.
    - Automatically modifies the SrvXXXX.c files updating headers and adding functions, files as needed.
    - Updates the MfgSrvCfg.h in the tools/contract folder to enable all services for QAC/Polyspace.
    - Creates *MfgSrvCfg.arxml in tools folder that will be imported into Configurator upon integration.
3. Update the AUTOSAR model as needed to define any inputs or outputs to support changes.
4. Run RteGen.bat as per typical component development.
5. Hand edit source files to add necessary content following component development guidelines.



Component Creation Guide
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create component structure using CreateComponent.bat script.
2. Create an ODX file describing all of the services for your program (See OdxGuide.txt for more information).
3. Save ODX file in doc folder and name it ProgMfgSrv.odx-d.
4. Copy OdxGen.bat from NM010A_ProgMfgSrv_Impl/tools into tools folder and execute it.
    - Creates source file templates for each service in src folder.
    - Creates MfgSrvCfg.h in tools/control to allow static analysis.
    - Creates a ProgMfgSrvCfg.arxml that will be imported into Configurator during integration.
5. Create AUTOSAR model as per component development guidelines and execute RteGen.bat.
6. Hand edit template SrvXXX.c files to populate with required content as per component development guidelines.
