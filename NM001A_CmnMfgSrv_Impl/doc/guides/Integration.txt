Nxtr Manufacturing Component Integration Guide
========================================================================================================================
The following guidelines apply when integrating both common of program specific service components.  The 


1. Bring component into project using Synergy as would be done for any component integration.
2. Import CmnMfgSrv.arxml or ProgMfgSrvCfg.arxml from tools folder into Configurator using File > Import.
    - On the second page, ensure the checkbox for NxtrMfgSrv component is checked before clicking [Finish].
    - If updating both CmnMfgSrv and ProgMfgSrv simultaneously, the imports of the arxml files must be done separately.
3. Manually merge the configuration into Configurator using the options provided.  Here are some general rules:
    - Typically add everything that has been added.
    - Typically keep all OTHER values on modified items (i.e. you typically want changes).
    - Typically IGNORE all removed items (Configurator will always want to remove previous Enable/Application settings).
4. Navigate to NxtrMfgSrv in the Basic Editor.
5. Enable all services listed in DSR by ticking the corresponding Enable checkbox
6. Select an Application from the select box if the service must write to RAM owned by an application other than CMS'.
    - CMS relies on a single Non-Trusted function call for each application in which a service must run.
    - Selecting a previously unused application from the list of available applications will generate the functions in
      MfgSrvCfg.c but will require the addition of the Non-Trusted function for that application in your OS settings in
      Configurator.
7. Set the software revision in Basic Editor > NxtrMfgSrv > NxtrMfgSrvGeneral.
8. Once configured, generate NxtrMfgSrv through the Configurator generation dialog.
    - Generates the source and header config files needed to configure services.
    - Generates a merged ODX file containing services from CmnMfgSrv.odx-d and ProgMfgSrv.odx-d.
    - Generates a trimmed ODX file containing only the services that were enabled in Configurator.
    - Generates an HTML reference document for enabled services.
    - All generated files are output to the generate folder of the integration project.
9. Build and flash to controller.
10. Run OdxTest.bat in TL110A_MfgSrvSuprt/tools folder to execute a basic test of the configuration against the ODX file.
    - The test requires a Peak tool for communication with the controller.
    - An HTML test report will open in your browser once the test completes.
    - This test does NOT replace functional test, it is only intended to point out gross configuration errors.
