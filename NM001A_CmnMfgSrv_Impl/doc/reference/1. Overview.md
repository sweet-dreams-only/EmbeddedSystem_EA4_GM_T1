Standards
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nxtr Manufacturing Services adhere to the ISO-14229 standard for Automotive Diagnostic Services as well as ISO-15765
(Transport Layer) standard for sending data packets over a CAN-Bus.


Connection Details
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Request ID (to ECU): 0x712  
Response ID (from ECU): 0x710


Byte Ordering
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All data is transfered in Motorola format (most significant byte first - also known as big-endian).


NvM Values
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For EA4, an ignition cycle or ECU reset is required to commit any and all stored values from Volatile Memory (RAM) to
Non-Volatile Memory (NvM).  When an auto trim, clear trim, write trim, or similar service is used to modify any value
stored in NvM a flag is set within the controller indicating that the value is to be written to NvM on the next 
shutdown.  The power cycle can be provided by means of a cycling of physical ignition (EPS ENA) or by issuing an ECU
reset (11 60) service.  The reception of a positive response from the ECU reset service indicates completion  of NvM
writes at which time it is safe to remove battery.
