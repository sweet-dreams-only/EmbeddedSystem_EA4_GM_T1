This component is intended to be used for generation of contract phase headers and c implementation templates of core software components.

The RTE generator license used for this is based of the one delivered for a GM project (see SIPLicense.lic in the RteGen4.3.0 directory).

The limitation due to this is that all components will get generated with this SIP identifier and the GM OEM name as part of the comments in the generated files.

Discussions with Vector are currently on-going to see if a license can be generated that will not contain OEM identifiers, but is currently not available.
