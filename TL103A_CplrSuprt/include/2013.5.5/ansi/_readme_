		Green Hills Software C Library Include Files

These include files should be placed in a directory such that in C the
statement "#include <file.h>" will include "file.h" from this directory.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The location and number of include files and directories differs slightly
between systems.  Below, the four large categories of systems have been
summarized.

1.  With native C and C++ compilers on Unix System V.4, header files are 
    provided in /usr/include which are compatible with Ansi C and C++.
    On such a system, this directory is not used.

    In K+R and Ansi C modes, only the native headers in /usr/include are used.
    In C++ mode, the directory containing GHS C++ header files is searched,
    followed by /usr/include.

2.  With native C and C++ compilers on certain Unix systems, header files are
    provided in /usr/include which are compatible with Ansi C, but not with C++.

    This situation requires special handling beyond the scope of this file.

3.  With native C and C++ compilers on a typical Unix system, header files are 
    provided in /usr/include.  In all modes of C and C++, the /usr/include 
    directory will be searched after all other directories mentioned below have 
    been searched.  In addition to /usr/include, there are 3 other directories
    containing include files.  This directory contains Ansi C include files,
    another directory contains C++ include files, and a third directory contains
    include files which are specific to the target system.  Typically the third
    directory will be found in a subdirectory of the directory which contains 
    GHS libraries, such as libansi.a.  For example, libansi.a may have the path
    /usr/green/libansi.a and the include files specific to this system will have
    the path /usr/green/include/*.h.

    The directories to be searched depend on the mode of compilation:

    Mode	Directories to be searched
    ----	--------------------------
    K+R C	only /usr/include

    Ansi C	First, the target specific directory	(/usr/green/include)
		Second, this Ansi C directory		(/usr/green/ansi)
		Third, /usr/include

    C++		First, the C++ directory		(/usr/green/cxx)
		Second, the target specific directory	(/usr/green/include)
		Third, this Ansi C directory		(/usr/green/ansi)
		Fourth, /usr/include

4.  With cross C and C++ compilers, as well as native compilers on a non-Unix 
    hosts, the following directories are searched depending on the mode of 
    compilation:

    Mode	    Directories to be searched
    ----	    --------------------------
    K+R or Ansi C   First, the target specific directory    (/usr/green/include)
		    Second, this Ansi C directory	    (/usr/green/ansi)

    C++		    First, the C++ directory		    (/usr/green/cxx)
		    Second, the target specific directory   (/usr/green/include)
		    Third, this Ansi C directory	    (/usr/green/ansi)
