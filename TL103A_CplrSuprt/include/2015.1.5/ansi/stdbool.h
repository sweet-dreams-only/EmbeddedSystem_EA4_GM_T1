    Details from ISO/IEC 9899:1999 regarding _Bool
    6.2.5, paragraph 2 
    an object of type _Bool is large enough to hold the values 0 and 1
    6.2.5, paragraph 6 
    (indicates indirectly that _Bool is an unsigned integer type.)
    6.3.1.1, paragraph 1 
    The rank of _Bool shall be less than the rank of all other standard
    integer types.
    6.3.1.1, paragraph 2 
    _Bool may be used as the base type of a bit-field.  
    6.3.1.2, paragraph 1
    When any scalar value is converted to _Bool, the result is 0
    if the value compares equal to 0; otherwise, the result is 1.

    The fact that _Bool has the lowest rank also implies that it has the
    smallest size, because if integral types have different precision,
    the type with the larger precision has the higher rank, based on
    other rules in 6.3.1.1 paragraph 1 which I have not quoted here.
