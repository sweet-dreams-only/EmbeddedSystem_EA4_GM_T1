After [selecting a program](1.1.) the drop-downs for baseline version will be automatically populated and enabled.
The tool allows generation of release notes that span multiple baseline versions but will default to the most recent
two baselines as determined by the baseline version numbers in increasing order.  This default is intended to produce
release notes for the most recent build as compared to it's immediate predecessor.  If a different range is desired
then alternate **From:** and **To:** selections can be made.

Both selections are inclusive and will be included in the generated report in addition to any baselines between the
selections.

After selecting the baselines the next step is to [configure the report contents](1.3.).
