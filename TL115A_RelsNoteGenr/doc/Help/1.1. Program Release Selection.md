The first step when using the GUI to generate release notes is to select the program from the drop-down at the top of the
window.  The drop-down is populated with a list of programs queried from the EA4 database as the tool starts.  The
database is first queried for all available releases before the list is filtered to remove any release that looks like
a component.

Upon selecting the release appropriate to the program for which you wish to generate release notes, the database will
again be queried for all available baseline under that release which brings us to [step 2](1.2.).
