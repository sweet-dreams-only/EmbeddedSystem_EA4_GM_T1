After completing the configuration, the generation can be kicked off by clicking the **[Generate]** button.  The main
window will be hidden and a dialog indicating the generation progress will be shown.  Closing this dialog or pressing
[Cancel] will abort generation and return you to the main window.

**Note:** The progress bar is updated after each section and sub-section is generated which shows progress but because
some sections take much longer than others the bar does not fill consistently.  Generation make take several minutes and
is relatively robust to errors during generation.  If an error occurs in a particular section or sub-section that unit
will be skipped and the corresponding content will be omitted from the report.  Check the log output for details on
what cause the exception.
