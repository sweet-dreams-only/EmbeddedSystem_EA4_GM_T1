========================================================================================================================
The file must contain two sections titled [processor] and [compiler].  Both sections are open-ended and may contain as
many or as few items as needed for your program.  Items are parsed and populated into tables where the table contains
two columns, one for the item name and the other for the item's value with one row per item.

The [processor] section can contain details about the target processor such as the manufacturer, part number, and
operating frequency.

The [compiler] section can contain details about the target compiler.  The compiler information would ideally be parsed
from the build output rather than pre-populated in such a config file but none of the options explored as of the time of
this writing produced a desirable result.  As such, this config file has been put forward as a substitute.
