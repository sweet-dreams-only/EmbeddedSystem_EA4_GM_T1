3.1. Bootloader Compatibility                                                                                    {#3.1.}
========================================================================================================================
Bootloader compatibility must be manually maintained.  Unfortunately there may be some convoluted methods to derive
which application versions are compatible with various bootloader versions but this is not bulletproof and also varies
across customers.  Instead, a simple matrix of applications and bootloaders is maintained within the doc folder and
parsed by the generator when invoked.
