After [selecting the baseline versions](1.2.) the next step is to configure the report contents.  Start by selecting the
scope of the release notes using the drop-down for **Target Audience**.  This will help limit the option presented in
the next step to avoid adding detailed or confidential information to reports targeted for certain audiences.

From that point, the exact contents of the report may be tailored using the tabs and check-boxes provided.  The tabs
correspond to the sections in the generated report while the check-boxes correspond to sub-sections.  A checked box will
include the corresponding sub-section while an un-checked box will exclude the sub-section.  If an entire section (i.e.
tab) is empty then the entire section will be excluded from the generated report.

After configuring the content a [report format](1.4.) must be selected.
