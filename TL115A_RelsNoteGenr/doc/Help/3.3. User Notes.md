3.3. User Notes                                                                                                  {#3.3.}
========================================================================================================================
The user notes document is located at the following location:

    INTEGRATION_PROJECT_FOLDER_RH850\doc\UserNotes.md

Where INTEGRATION_PROJECT_FOLDER_RH850 is replaced with the name of your integration project folder and UserNotes.md is
the exact filename.

The .md extension corresponds to [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting.  The generation tool
supports a limited subset of the markdown standard including bold and italic markup as well as tables from the
Markdown Extra standard.

The contents of the file as very open ended.  It is expected that this file will be used by the integrator to document
any oddities or major changes in version of software but not anomalies as those are already handled via the open
anomalies section.  Typical items for this file include things such as notifications of EEPROM shifts, abnormal
bootloader update sequences, changes in service IDs or security that may alter a user's interaction, etc.  This is
intended to be a first-line location for end users of the software to start when they come up against some kind of issue
before they write an anomaly.
